The following application creates a histogram that allows you to visually inspect the 
frequency distribution of a set of values. The program reads in an arbitrary number of integers that are in the range of 1 to 100 inclusive; then produce a chart like the one below that indicates how many input values fell in the range 1 to 10, 11 to 20, and so on. Print an asterisk for each value 
entered

1- 10 | ****
11-20 | **
21-30 | *****************************************
31-40 | 
41-50 | ***
51-60 | *********
61-70 | **
71-80 | ******
81-90 | *********
91-100 | *************

The process to acomplish the goal of this program consists in:
// Prompt the user to enter a list of integers.
// As long as the integers entered are within the desired range.
// Increasing the appropriate histogram.
// Print Histrogram.
